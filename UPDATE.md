# Optimal Power Generation using MATLAB

This project simulates and analyzes optimal power generation using MATLAB. It is designed for academic use, showcasing how power systems can be optimized based on load conditions and resource availability.

##  Project Objective
- The objective of this project is to design a MATLAB-based system that models and simulates optimal power generation for efficient energy distribution.
- It aims to minimize energy loss and optimize load sharing among multiple power generation sources. This simulation also helps in understanding how real-world power systems respond to changing load demands.

##  Tools Used
- MATLAB R2023a
- Simulink (optional, if used)
- Graph Plotting Utilities

##  Files Included
- .m script files for simulation
- Sample input and output data
- Graphs showing simulation results

##  Key Features
- Efficient load sharing algorithm  
- Real-time simulation of power system behavior  
- Customizable parameters for generation and load units  
- MATLAB-based logic to optimize power generation  
- Load demand vs supply balancing  
- Visualization of results through plots and graphs  
- Academic-level simulation project
